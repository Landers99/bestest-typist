# Contributing

1. Create a branch from `main`: `feature/<issue-number>-short-slug`.
2. Keep PRs small (aim <300 lines changed).
3. Link the issue in your PR description (`Fixes #123`).
4. Add/Update tests; CI must pass.
5. One approval required to merge.

## Commit message style
Use clear, present-tense messages. If you prefer, follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`).
